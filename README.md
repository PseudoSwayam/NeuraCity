# 🧠 NeuraCity — AI Nervous System for Smart Campuses

NeuraCity is a full-stack, AI-first intelligent system designed to bring real-time awareness, safety, insights, and automation to physical institutions like college campuses, hospitals, airports, and smart cities.  

> Think of it as the **AI nervous system** for any multi-building campus — sensing, analyzing, and acting across modalities.

## 🚨 Problem

Modern institutions lack intelligent, unified systems that can:
- Detect emergencies or distress in real-time
- Understand crowd and engagement behavior
- Provide seamless, personalized interactions
- Fuse data from cameras, sensors, systems, and chat interfaces
- Automate critical actions across infrastructure

---

## 🧠 The Vision

NeuraCity solves this by bringing together:
- 🔍 Computer Vision for real-world event detection
- 🎙️ Audio + NLP + GenAI for natural interactions
- 📊 Data Science dashboards for insights
- 🤖 IoT for environmental and personal sensing
- 🧠 Memory + Agentic AI for real-time, contextual automation

## 🚀 MVP Goals (8–10 Weeks)
	•	✅ Vision model detects: fall, distress, raised hand, lone woman
	•	✅ IoT triggers: pulse drop, motion in restricted zones
	•	✅ GenAI chatbot: answers institutional queries
	•	✅ InsightCloud: trends in attendance, events, occupancy
	•	✅ MemoryCore: ask what happened in any zone/time
	•	✅ ReflexSystem: auto-trigger emergency emails/alerts
