# ðŸ”” Reflex System

This module handles autonomous responses based on AI detections or sensor inputs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Enable the system to:
- Trigger automated alerts (SMS, email, dashboard)
- Dispatch emergency instructions (to security/staff)
- Activate smart locks, alarms, or logs (via API or MQTT)

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure (Recommended)

```bash
reflex_system/
â”œâ”€â”€ triggers/         # Predefined reflex logic
â”œâ”€â”€ api/              # Alert APIs or Webhooks
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/             # Generated action logs
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## âœ… Tasks

- [ ] Define rules like: "Fall + Low Pulse = Ambulance alert"
- [ ] Implement auto-SMS/email dispatch system
- [ ] Integrate with backend and memory logs

Update this file with reflex rules, logic trees, or workflows implemented.
